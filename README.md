# CodeTrail 🧠📈  
_LeetCode-style practice tracker with AI feedback on your attempts_

CodeTrail is a full-stack web app that helps you track coding interview practice over time.  
You can add problems from LeetCode (or any source), log multiple attempts per question, and get **AI feedback** on where you’re going wrong and how to improve.

You can:

- Add questions with title, link, difficulty, and notes  
- Log multiple attempts per question with time spent and whether you needed help  
- Request **AI feedback on a single attempt or all attempts** for a question  
- Build a history of how your understanding improves every time you revisit a problem

## ✨ Features

- **Secure authentication**
  - Email + password login via BetterAuth
  - Session management with secure cookies

- **Question management**
  - Store problem title, URL (e.g. LeetCode link), difficulty, and notes
  - Edit questions as your understanding of the problem evolves

- **Attempt logging**
  - Log multiple attempts for each question
  - Track time spent, whether you needed hints/solutions, and what you struggled with
  - Use notes to capture patterns, edge cases, and “gotchas” in your own words

- **AI feedback on attempts**
  - Request AI feedback on a **single attempt** to understand what went wrong
  - Or analyze **all attempts for a question** to see overall patterns and recurring mistakes
  - Get suggestions for alternative approaches, things to focus on, and what to practice next

- **Progress & organization**
  - Question Details page with a full attempt history and AI feedback
  - Designed to act like a personal learning log rather than just a checklist

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend & Backend**: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components  
- **Auth**: BetterAuth with PostgreSQL adapter  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (e.g. Neon) via Drizzle ORM  
- **AI**:
  - AI provider (e.g. OpenAI / Gemini / similar) for attempt analysis
  - Server-side routes for securely calling the AI API
- **Other**:
  - Next.js Server Actions for data mutations
  - Strong TypeScript types for users, questions, attempts, and AI feedback

## 🖼️ Core Concepts

CodeTrail revolves around a few key data models:

- **User** – The authenticated user profile  
- **Question** – A coding problem with title, URL, difficulty, and notes  
- **Attempt** – One practice run at a question:
  - Time spent  
  - Whether you needed help  
  - What you struggled with  
  - Your own reflections  
- **AI Feedback** – Model-generated analysis tied to a question and/or specific attempts:
  - Explanation of what you’re doing wrong  
  - Suggestions for improving your approach  
  - Patterns across multiple attempts  

Together, these make CodeTrail a **learning log**, not just a list of problems you’ve solved.
